# Power Consumption Time Series Analysis
ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project focuses on time series analysis and forecasting of power consumption data from multiple zones within a smart grid environment.
Originally, the dataset contained combined data for all zones, but I manually separated each zone (Zone 1, Zone 2, etc.) into individual datasets to allow for zone-specific modeling and comparison.

Each zone is analyzed independently to better capture its unique consumption behavior, seasonal trends, and anomaly patterns.
